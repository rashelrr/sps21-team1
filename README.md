Project: Social Movement Tracker
Program: Google Software Product Sprint

Created a web application that serves as a community-made resource guide on current social movements. 
Users can submit information about new social movements:
- name
- description
- movement hashtag
- video link
- an image

as well as read up on them. This information is then converted into a new page on the website with
popular tweets about the movement. Worked on a team of 3 students with project advisor Enrique Padilla. 

## Built With
